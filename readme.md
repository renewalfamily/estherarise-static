## Esther Arise 1111 website - 2017 (Archived) 
This is the Esther Arise 1111 static website in 2017. The original website link http://estherarise1111.org has been cancelled. 

I deployed this website into Netlify.com. The link is https://heuristic-galileo-ef3867.netlify.app/ and set a new domain name as https://1111.brideofchrist.ca/.
The website is also liked to Renewal Family's website https://www.renewalfamily.org/.
