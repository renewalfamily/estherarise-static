            <h3>THE YIELDING</h3>
            <p><strong>Hear David Demian sharing at the launch of the 40 Days of The Yielding:</strong>
                <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n9c0bey44jfmrwh/TheYielding_Intro_DavidDemian.mp3?dl=0" target="_blank"
                   rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a></p>
            <p>The Lord has been speaking prophetically concerning a forty-day period in which He will perform a work of
                preparation and consecration in the lives of His faithful remnant<strong>. </strong>As we sought the Lord
                regarding this time, we longed for language that would best describe what we were sensing deep within His heart.
                It seemed to be something deeper than would be expressed by the word consecration, which means to be set apart;
                although that is vital and precious, we realized that God intends to draw us further to a place of being united
                in oneness of spirit with Him. We began to hear the word “yielding,” and we realized that the forty days are to
                be a time of yielding to the Lord in order to become one with Him in a way we have never yet experienced<strong>.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>In this season of acceleration, it is on God’s heart to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. The Spirit
                spoke to us that the dates of this time of yielding were to be from November 11 through the last day of
                Hanukkah, on December 20. He took us to three portions of Scripture to reveal His intention for us during this
                time.</p>
            <p>The first portion is from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zech+3&amp;version=NIV"
                                            target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Zechariah 3</strong></a> that gives the
                account of the changing of Joshua the high priest&#8217;s garments, and the removal of the accusations that had
                soiled them. The Spirit will do the same for us as individuals and as families. We have “worn” accusations as we
                believed them, coming into agreement and seeing them as truth; but in reality they are not accusations against
                us, but against our Father. These lies have soiled our garments and wounded our unity with the One who chose us.
                God invites us to stand before Him in quietness and solitude, alone and with other family members, to allow Him
                to remove accusations that have become soiled garments. Accusations against the truth of His character and His
                faithfulness will be removed, and we will be restored to “one spirit with Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:17).</p>
            <p>The second portion of Scripture is found in Luke 1:38, when the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary, announcing
                that she would conceive a child as the Holy Spirit came upon her. She responded,</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><strong> <em>“Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.”</em> </strong> (Luke
                1:38 NKJV)</p>
            <p>This is the heart of our posture, of yielding to what He has spoken. The Spirit of God will come upon us these
                next forty days to clothe us with new garments and to restore our authority, which has been weakened as we
                allowed accusations against His holiness and truth to soil our lives and our families.</p>
            <p>The last portion of Scripture comes from Zechariah 4:6,</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><strong><em>Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, “This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying,
                ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ saith the Lord of hosts.</em></strong></p>
            <p>This is not a work of the flesh but a gift of mercy from the Lord. We yield, but the Spirit will accomplish all
                that is in His heart. Yielding does not require self-examination, but instead involves trust, inviting and
                allowing the Holy Spirit to come upon us in order to accomplish the will of God in our lives.</p>
            <p>Joshua’s restoration and purification were a result of the Lord’s sovereign act. Joshua did nothing but stand,
                while the Lord performed what needed to be done. Mary yielded as God’s maidservant, to allow His holy will to be
                accomplished. They both experienced a sovereign act of God, even though they had done nothing to deserve it. We
                believe these forty days will be powerful as the body of Christ yields to His authority in order to see Him
                accomplish that which we cannot do for ourselves.</p>
            <p>The forty days will be broken up into five eight-day segments, culminating with the eight days of Hanukkah.
                Each eight-day segment will have an inspirational invitation to help you enter in and yield your heart. We
                encourage you to consider partaking in communion as often as the Spirit leads during this time, as it will be an
                intricate part of aligning with truth and yielding to His Spirit.</p>
            <p>Feel free to invite other to join us in this holy time together.</p>

                The Accuser, Satan, was there at the angel’s right hand, making accusations against Joshua. And the Lord said to
                Satan, “I, the Lord, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This
                man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from the fire.”</em></strong> <a

            <p>The Lord desires to address the accuser that has brought accusations against your life and your loved ones, as
                well as accusations against His true nature and character. We encourage you to take time alone, and with others,
                to allow the Spirit to reveal those accusations that you have worn as garments. He will help you break agreement
                with lies you have believed and spoken. He will rebuke the enemy and silence the accusations.</p>
            <p>Each day, throughout these eight days, stand before the Lord and ask the Spirit to reveal and remove all
                accusations that have raised themselves against the knowledge of the Holy One.</p>

            <h4>NOVEMBER 19 - 26 FOCUS</h4>
            <p>We continue our posture of yielding, in our second eight-day segment, with the words Mary spoke in Luke
                1:38,</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><strong><em>“Be it unto me according to your word.”</em></strong></p>
            <p>Our reading for this eight-day period comes from Zechariah 3:3-4:</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><strong><em>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel. Then
                He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, “Take away the filthy garments from him.” And to
                him He said, “See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes.”</em></strong></p>
            <p>As we come before the Lord, we will once again see the Holy Spirit do for us what we cannot do for ourselves.
                He will remove the filthy garments that represent shame, trauma, false identity, and accusations against us and
                against the true character of God. We will allow Him to remove our iniquities and clothe us with the
                righteousness of Christ.</p>
            <p>Angels have come to assist us during this time of yielding. They are servants that have come to prepare the
                Bride, making her ready for to walk in the authority that unity with God provides for her.</p>
            <p>Partaking of communion continues to be a beautiful aspect of this time of yielding. As we remember the price
                that Jesus paid, the perfect sacrifice He gave, and the grace by which we have been saved, we are drawn into
                tangible transformation.</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><em><strong>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the
                righteousness of God.</strong></em> 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the Lord invites us into His presence, to partake of His lovingkindness and allow Him to usher us
                into a new level of unity and oneness of spirit that we have not previously known.</p>

                ‭Zechariah‬ ‭3:5‬ ‭</p>
            <p>In His grace and mercy, God first plucked us like a brand from the fire when we were saved (Zechariah 3:2) and
                His grace and mercy cleanses us from our iniquities (Zechariah 3:4). Now, we yield once again to the grace of
                God’s love to clothe us in new garments, rich and clean. We are clothed in the righteousness of Christ and we
                receive the incomparable riches that He paid for with His blood and body.</p>
            <p>We not only present our lives, but we carry with us the lives of those we love and those He died for, so they
                too might be saved, washed, and clothed anew. We come fully dependent upon His mercy and love to renew our
                minds—place a new turban on our head—and wash our garments so our lives are free from every conformity to the
                patterns of the world. We receive, with grateful hearts, the rich robes that only the Priests of the Lord can
                wear.</p>
            <p>We are in a time where God is asking us to yield to His Spirit in order to leave the old behind. We are in a
                new season, and are being made ready for the new. Though we’ve never been this way before, and do not know what
                the “new” will look like, we put our trust in the One who knows the end from the beginning and prepares us for
                the days ahead.</p>
            <p>Again, we posture our hearts like Mary and say to the Lord,</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><em><strong>“Be it unto me according to your word.” (Luke 1:38)</strong></em></p>
            <p>Take this third segment of the forty-day “Yielding” to gather with family and friends, as well as to allow time
                privately before the Lord, so that He can clothe you with new garments. This is a time where He will renew minds
                and give us clean hands and pure hearts so that we may walk in oneness with our Savior.</p>

            <p class="pl-3"><strong><em>The angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua: “This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.’”</em> </strong>(Zechariah 3:6-7)</p>
            <p>As we enter the fourth eight-day segment of our Forty-Days of Yielding, we rejoice greatly in all that God has already done for us. We are experiencing a renewal as He completes the preparation of our lives to walk in greater unity with Him and with one another. We freshly perceive our lives through the righteousness of Christ, for we understand that we have been clothed in Him; and we view our loved ones and neighbors as He sees them, rather than the way the accuser seeks to define them. We have been washed of iniquities and have broken agreement with lies. Now we will commit anew to walk in obedience and to keep all of His requirements so that we may be carriers of His authority and “govern His house” in truth and justice.</p>
            <p>This will be a time that authority is reestablished and servant leaders are set in place. No longer will there be an abuse of authority in the Lord’s house, but we will lead as He leads—committing to only do what we see the Father doing. We will love as He loves and move as He moves.</p>
            <p>This is the answer to the prayer of Jesus in John 17,</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><strong><em>“My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.” </em></strong>(John 17:20-23)</p>
            <p>May we be the ones who answer His heart’s desire!</p>

            <h4>Focus for December 13 – December 20</h4>
            <p><strong><em>“Eight Days of Miracles”</em></strong></p>
            <p>We complete our time during the eight days of Hanukkah, the Jewish “Festival of Lights.” This is a celebration of the miracle that occurred in the second century B.C., during the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. At that time, the Holy Land was ruled by the Syrian-Greeks, who had forced the people of Israel to accept Greek culture and beliefs rather than God’s ways. Against all odds, a small band of faithful Jews, led by Judah Maccabee, defeated one of the strongest armies on earth. They drove their oppressors from the land and reclaimed the Holy Temple, rededicating it to the service of God. When His people went to light the Temple’s menorah, they found only a single cruse of pure olive oil that had escaped contamination by the Greeks. They lit the menorah, and miraculously, the one-day supply of oil lasted for eight days, until new oil could be prepared under the conditions for ritual purity.</p>
            <p>In Scripture, the number five can represent “grace” and eight “new beginnings.” We are completing our fifth eight-day period—this time of grace the Lord has graciously renewed and restored us, individually and collectively, and is allowing us to shine more brightly with His glory as we burn with the purified oil of our offering. We are being made ready to dwell in eternity with the Light of the World.</p>
            <p class="pl-3"><strong><em>“‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the LORD Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.’”</em></strong> Zechariah 3:8-9</p>
            <p>We have found that the Lord has made us one spirit with Him in a way we have not known before. The eyes of our hearts are filled with light (Ephesians 1:18) and we rejoice in greater faith and authority to bring His righteousness to our lands.</p>
