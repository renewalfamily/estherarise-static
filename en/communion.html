            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Communion is a gift and a joy. It is a door to intimacy with God, a living well of healing &amp; refreshing, an invitation to be transformed into His likeness. When I first discovered the wonders of communion, I was so overwhelmed that He would give us such a gift! So, let us begin to open this gift &amp; see what’s inside!</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I remember years ago my high school vice principal once mentioned that she took communion everyday. I had never heard of anyone taking communion daily. Why would she do that? Another time, I heard a missionary mention how they spent several days taking communion together in a place in China. I was intrigued. What did they do all that time? How could something that takes us only 15 min take several days for them! Years later when I was meditating on John 6， I began to understand why. But before I share this, let me tell you a story of the power of communion.</p>
            <p>One day I discovered bedbugs in my home. I was anxious &amp; unravelled. The pest control company came with a dog &amp; detected bedbug activity in two bedrooms &amp; the living room. They needed to fumigate the rooms &amp; before they could do that, I needed to empty all the closets &amp; cabinets &amp; launder my clothes. It took many days to do that because there were a lot of things in my home! As I sought the Lord about this, He spoke to me that He had a way of dealing with the bedbugs &amp; it was not man’s way. Once I was done with my cleaning &amp; giving things away, He would show me His simple method, a little secret weapon. Three weeks later, He gave me the key.</p>
            <p>“My method &amp; weapon is prayer. Establish an altar in the center of the rooms, raise up high praises &amp; worship, adoration, tongues, declarations of the Word; take communion for cleansing &amp; purification of the land &amp; space, re-establish your covenant with Me, to dedicate this house &amp; everything in it to Me, then I will cleanse My house. I will have no other idols/gods. Remove EVERYTHING that is abominable to Me. So continue with the cleaning as you also begin intentional &amp; intensive worship &amp; daily communion in all 3 rooms &amp; the living room &amp; kitchen. Let there be a continuous flow of my Presence &amp; worship in all these areas, the whole house. Ah, it is time! I am jealous for you. I am jealous for your time &amp; attention. This altar of worship, sacrifice of the heart &amp; deep communion with me will suffice to completely eradicate the bedbugs for you as long as you are here.”</p>
            <p>It worked! His awesome presence came the first day as I knelt to take communion, &amp; I wept in repentance. I never saw any bedbugs after that. There was power in worship &amp; communion for cleansing land &amp; space.</p>
            <h4>Light from John 6 : Feeding on Christ</h4>
            <p>We took communion once a month in the church I grew up in &amp; our pastor would always read from 1Cor 11. We would take a moment to repent of our sins, then take the bread &amp; grape juice with thanksgiving. It was a simple &amp; holy ritual in obedience to Christ’s command: “Do this in remembrance of Me”. But one day as I meditated on John 6, I suddenly saw another precious dimension of communion.</p>
            <p>John 6: 51-57 “I am the living bread that came down from heaven…. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world….Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains (abides or dwells) in me, and I in him.<br>
                Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.”</p>
            <p>What is this “eating His flesh &amp; drinking His blood” that is so essential to eternal life &amp; remaining in Him (v56) ? We know that “remaining in Christ” is the recurring theme in John 15 &amp; the main key Jesus gave us to life in the spirit &amp; fruitfulness.</p>
            <p>John 15:4-7 “Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit, apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.”</p>
            <p>So what is “eating His flesh &amp; drinking His blood” which enables us to remain in Christ? Where else does Jesus mention about eating His body &amp; drinking His blood? Communion.</p>
            <p>Matt 26: 26-28 “While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, &quot;Take and eat; this is my body.&quot; Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, &quot;Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”</p>

            <h3>Day 1 - Covenant Of Love In Eternity</h3>
            <p>One day as I waited on the Lord with my bread &amp; cup, I heard the words: “Covenant to meet you in eternity”. Tears came to my eyes as I realized Jesus, my loving bridegroom is waiting for me in Heaven! “But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.&quot; (Mat 26:29 NKJ).</p>
            <p>When Jesus said “this is the blood of my new covenant” (Matt 26:28), it was like in an engagement, a betrothal ceremony, when the Groom promised His love to His Bride. His new covenant is a covenant of eternal love. “I give my life for you, My Bride, I promise you my eternal love.” His token of love was not a ring, but His blood. Jesus died for a bride! And now when I take communion, I remember I am His beautiful Bride, we are His beautiful corporate Bride that He is waiting &amp; longing for! We, His people, are already engaged to Him, but there remains a glorious Wedding Day yet to come (Rev.19:7-8)! Our lover is waiting for us &amp; He is faithful to His covenant of love to us! We live under a covering of eternal covenant love! His banner over us is LOVE!</p>
            <p>When we take communion, we not only remember our Bridegroom’s pledge of love to us, but we, the engaged bride, take time to give Him our love &amp; reaffirm our single-hearted devotion to Him till we meet face to face, forever. We renew our vows, we reconsecrate ourselves to Him alone. Communion is a time of deep spirit to spirit communion when lovers meet &amp; become one. “Beautiful Bridegroom Jesus, here I am, your beautiful Bride. As I remember &amp; receive Your pledge of eternal love, I say, I love You, I give you my devotion, my heart, my life, my love, as only You deserve. You are the desire of my heart. I love You, I honor You, I yield my all to You alone.”</p>
            <p>My communion experience: As you take communion, remember your bridegroom Jesus is waiting for you. He keeps His covenant with you. Will you pledge your devotion too?</p>

            <h3>Day 2 - Divine Union</h3>
            <p>One day as I waited on the Lord with my cup, He spoke: “Bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh.” When God made Eve out of Adam’s rib &amp; brought her to him, Adam exclaimed that the woman was “bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh”. “Therefore a man shall leave his father &amp; mother &amp; be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” (Gen 2:21-24) Paul uses the same terms to speak of our relationship with Christ. He is our heavenly Bridegroom &amp; we are His corporate Bride, the wife of the Lamb. (Rev 19:7-8, 21:9) We are “of His flesh &amp; of His bones”, and we are to be joined one flesh with Him! (Eph 5:30-32) * He is longing for the fullness of our spiritual union with Him, He in us &amp; we in Him. No longer many but One, no longer two but One. All that He is, in us &amp; for us, all that He is, in me &amp; for me. A little word study on the word “join” דָבַ֣ק (dabaq) shows it is also translated “cleave, cling, hold fast, stick close, bound, stay close, deeply attracted” .** In our joining as one, He cleaves to us &amp; we to Him, He sticks to us &amp; we to Him! But even more so, our spiritual union with Christ is compared to the intimate union of man &amp; woman.</p>
            <p>“Jesus, You call us “bone of my bones &amp; flesh of my flesh ”. We come from You &amp; are forever joined to You. Our hearts &amp; spirits cling to You, cleave to You, hold fast to You, stick to You. But it’s more about Your yearning for us! You cling to us! You cleave to us! You hold fast to us! You desire us! You join Yourself with us! You stick to us! You never leave us! You are the Perfect heavenly Bridegroom who gave Your life for us. You sanctify us &amp; cleanse us to make us beautiful &amp; glorious! You love us, nourish us &amp; cherish us. You died to save us, how much more will You continue to pay any price to protect us &amp; fulfill all Your dreams for us! As we take this cup, we receive &amp; affirm that we are bone of Your bones, flesh of Your flesh, forever attached, joined, belonging &amp; longing for You alone! Glorious Husband, we yield to You &amp; come in full submission to You. O Divine Union, You in us &amp; we in You!”</p>

            <p>*Eph 5: 22-32 “Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church. For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

            <p>Prov 18:24 “A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer דָבַ֣ק than a brother.”</p>

            <h3>Day 3 - Revelation Of The Cross</h3>
            <p>My prayer has been: “Lord, give me a revelation of the cross. I so desire to know the full extent of Your love for Your bride, that I may be changed &amp; love You as You deserve!”</p>
            <p>I remember watching traditional tribal dances of Malaysian first peoples that were all about the price the bridegroom was willing to pay to protect his bride. But the love of our perfect heavenly Bridegroom is so much more! There is no greater love than that the Creator of the universe would become man, be rejected &amp; die in the hands of sinful men in order to make dust like us a glorious Bride to reign &amp; rule with the King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords! O amazing Love!</p>
            <p>Sometimes I like to physically hold &amp; feel a wooden cross I have when I take communion. It helps to draw my heart to Jesus &amp; His cross. One day as I tenderly held the cross with a desire to connect to His heart, I was suddenly overwhelmed with a revelation of His love &amp; the price He paid for me. I could only weep &amp; pray, “O Lord, captivate my heart, soften my heart, humble my heart, change my heart….”</p>
            <p>Another day, with the cross in my hands, the words came to me: “For the joy set before Him endured the cross, scorning shame” (Heb 12:2). I realized Jesus was seeing us &amp; thinking of us, the glorious bride He would have when He was on the cross. We were His prize &amp; passion that strengthened &amp; uplifted Him in the darkest hour! I prayed, “O Lord, now You are my joy &amp; prize. The very thought of You &amp; Your cross will give me courage &amp; hope to persevere &amp; overcome in trials &amp; persecution!”</p>
            <p>Another time as I held the cross, I remembered Phil 2:5-8</p>
            <p>“Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-- even death on a cross!”</p>
            <p>“O Lord, give me Your heart. Let me embrace the cross, not just the glory but the shame, remembering the price you paid….that I may die to self &amp; live only to please You.”</p>
            <p>My communion experience: “Lord Jesus, as I come with bread &amp; wine, I ask for a revelation of Your cross. What did you feel when you were on the cross? What were you thinking, what were you feeling?” Quiet your heart to listen to His response.</p>

            <h3>Day 4 - Divine Romance</h3>
            <p>Jesus said, “This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” (1Cor 11:25) Someone said, Jesus is like a passionate lover who doesn’t want His beloved to forget Him, so He established the communion for us to continually remember His love. When we take communion, we are drawn to His heart longing for our love &amp; we say, “here I am, my Love, I remember. I receive Your love for me &amp; I love You…….”</p>

            <h3>Day 5 - Superlative Love</h3>
            <p>One day the word came to me: Superlative love, the love that rises above all things, the love that is incomparable, infinite, not of this world, gloriously victorious. God’s every character is superlative. Someone put it well, that every quality of God is millions of times, infinitely more than anything we’ve ever known or seen of that quality. His patience is superlative, a million times of what we know or can imagine of “patience”. His holiness is superlative, a million times of what we know or can imagine of “holiness”. His love, joy, peace, boldness, faithfulness, wisdom, heart of forgiveness &amp; grace are superlative &amp; a million times of what we know &amp; can imagine of these qualities.</p>
            <p>What is His superlative love? The love Jesus had in His heart as He knelt &amp; washed Judas’ feet, knowing he was going to betray Him that very night. The love Jesus had in His heart as He prayed on the cross, “Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” (Lk 23:34). The love that “bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (1Cor 13:7) The love that “while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</p>
            <p>As we come to the communion table &amp; remember His superlative love, let us pray, “Jesus, I ask for Your superlative love. Fill me, change me, free me by Your superlative love, that the pain of hurts &amp; injustices will melt away, the ugliness of sin will be replaced, and I may live &amp; breathe Your divine, superlative love.”</p>

            <h3>Day 6 - Holy Of Holies</h3>
            <p>When Jesus shared that last Passover meal with His disciples, He showed them He was the true Passover Lamb that would bring full deliverance to God’s people. The first Passover had set the Jewish people free from slavery, but God was still distant. Only the High Priest could enter the Holy of Holies before God’s awesome Presence once a year on the Day of Atonement. But through the cross, Jesus made the way for us to become the new covenant bride who can now enter the Holy of Holies into the very Presence of God and enjoy intimate spirit to spirit union with Him. What amazing grace! What an awesome privilege, that frail human beings can come into spiritual oneness with the Great I Am! Every time we take Communion, it is an opportunity to enter into the Holy of Holies through His blood, to gaze upon Him face to face &amp; be changed from glory to glory.</p>
            <p>“For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.” (1Co 5:7) “We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body.” (Heb 10:19-20)</p>
            <p>But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit. (2Co 3:18)</p>

            <h2>3. Repentance</h2>
            <h3>Day 7</h3>
            <p>So often, when I come into His Presence before the cross in communion, I cannot but recognize my sinfulness &amp; repent deeply. When I look at Jesus on the cross &amp; touch His love, I cannot but realize the hardness of my heart &amp; melt in sorrow. It’s His kindness that leads us to repentance. (Rom 2:4) Repentance is about acknowledging our sins &amp; turning from them. But it is even more about the greatness of God’s love &amp; the sufficiency of the blood of Christ. Hallelujah! In communion, His love draws us to a place of repentance , but from the place of humility &amp; repentance, He fills us with Himself! When we repent of fear, He fills us with His peace; when we repent of pride, He fills us with His tenderness! Amazing grace!</p>
            <p>My communion experience : Ask the Lord to show you where you have sinned, where you have grieved His spirit.</p>

            <h2>4. LIFE - Impartation Of Jesus’ Life</h2>
            <p>Communion is about receiving the very life of Christ in exchange for mine.</p>
            <p>Jesus said, “Take, eat, this is my body.” (Matt 26:26) “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains (abides or dwells) in me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on(eats) me will live because of me.(John 6:56-57)</p>
            <p>“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion*(sharing, participation) of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion (sharing,participation) of the body of Christ?” (1Cor 10:16) *</p>
            <p>In communion, we not only repent &amp; receive His atonement for our sins with thanksgiving, but we must also “eat” His body. That means absorbing, digesting, receiving the very life of Jesus deep into our being &amp; allowing it to nourish &amp; transform us to become like Him. How do we do that? Through prayer &amp; meditation.</p>

            <h3>Day 8 - Prayer 1</h3>
            <p>In prayer , we open our spirit to receive Him and all His qualities. Breathe in deeply &amp; slowly as you pray to receive Him into your being.</p>
            <p>“Lord, I receive deep into my spirit Your Life, Your Presence, all that You are. I receive &amp; breathe in Your Perfect Love, Your overflowing joy, Your supernatural peace, Your unlimited patience, Your kindness, Your goodness, Your faithfulness, Your gentleness, Your self-control, Your humility, Your boldness, Your heart. I receive the Spirit of the Lord – the Spirit of wisdom &amp; understanding, the Spirit of counsel &amp; might, the Spirit of knowledge &amp; the fear of the Lord. Lord, I desire You, more of You &amp; less of me, all of You &amp; none of me! Fill me to the max! No longer I who live, but Christ lives in me!” (Gal 2:20)</p>
            <p>As we receive Jesus into our being, a divine exchange goes on whereby our insecurities, fears, bitterness, hardness &amp; pride melt away &amp; His peace &amp; tenderness take over. We don’t need to strive to become like Jesus. As we eat &amp; drink Him often, He becomes the food that nourishes us &amp; we are changed into His likeness day by day!</p>

            <p>In prayer, we receive His mind, eyes, ears, mouth, hands, feet &amp; heart to be our own. But first we cleanse &amp; consecrate each of these to Him.</p>

Now I receive Your heart to love and feel as You do. I receive Your desires. O Jesus, live in me &amp; through me!” (2Cor 10:5; John 5: 19,30; Jn 12: 49-50; Luke 4:22,32; John 6:63; Heb 4:12)</p>
            <p>Jesus said, “Take, eat, this is my body, given for you.” When we eat &amp; live from the life of Jesus, we are eating &amp; living from the tree of life &amp; no longer from the tree of good &amp; evil!</p>

            <h3>Day 10 - Meditation On His Life &amp; Words 1</h3>
            <p>Jesus said that as we eat, we are to remember Him - His love, His life, His words. He also said, &quot; He who feeds on (eats) me will live…The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.” (Jn 6:57,63) As we meditate prayerfully on his life &amp; his words, we are feeding on Him &amp; receiving impartation of His life.</p>
            <p>How do we meditate? We visualize the scenes of the Bible stories, we see the surroundings, we sense the atmosphere &amp; hear the sounds. Sometimes we enter in &amp; imagine ourselves to be a participant; we become the one healed or the father of the healed. Sometimes we put ourselves into the shoes of Jesus &amp; try to feel His heart &amp; emotions. We talk with Jesus and we ask Him questions. Always, we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us &amp; give revelation.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I focus &amp; “feed” on specific areas that I feel I need Him most, eg. security &amp; peace. I would read and meditate on His words， &amp; one or more stories in His life related to these areas. I try to go inside Jesus, and sense how He felt &amp; how He lived from His core being. I try to sense His mind &amp; heart.</p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong> - “Lord Jesus, You always knew You were Father’s beloved Son that brings Him great joy. (Matt 3:17) You were so secure in who You are , You had no fear of man. I want that. As I take this bread symbolizing Your very life, I receive this same certainty that I am Abba’s beloved child, He delights in me! You were so secure in Father’s love, you could face rejection &amp; opposition. You didn’t have to please men. You weren’t afraid to heal the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath even though you knew the Pharisees disapproved of that. (Matt 12:9-14) Wow! I need that! I receive Your deep security &amp; courage to do the right thing &amp; not fear man!”</p>
            <p><strong>Peace</strong> - “ Jesus, You are the Prince of Peace who lives in me. You said, “Peace I leave with you; My peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” (John 14:27) I receive Your supernatural peace. I allow Your divine shalom peace to fill &amp; saturate every cell &amp; every part of my being, body soul &amp; spirit. I live &amp; breathe Your supernatural peace. I remember when Your own people in Nazareth got mad at You &amp; tried to push You down the cliff, You were so full of peace You just walked right through the angry crowd &amp; went on Your way! (Luke 4:28-30) I receive that peace now. I remember when the disciples’ boat was about to capsize in the raging storm, You were in such peace that You were fast asleep. You were still full of peace when the fearful disciples woke You. You simply commanded, “Peace, be still !” and the storm ceased. (Mark 4:37) I receive Your peace that overcomes every storm to rule in my heart now. (Col 3:15) I carry Your supernatural peace &amp; I will bring it wherever I go today!”</p>
            <p>My communion experience: As you remember Him in communion, think of the particular quality He had that you need now. When &amp; how did he show that quality? Take &amp; eat from Him.</p>

            <h3>Day 11 - Meditation On His Life &amp; Words 2</h3>
            <p>Sometimes I simply ask, “Lord, as I receive this bread &amp; cup from You, what do You want me to remember about You today?”</p>
            <p><strong>Widow of Nain</strong> One time the Lord led me to meditate on the story of the widow of Nain in Lk 7:11-16. “Lord, I feel Your heart of compassion for the bereaved widow. I see Your eyes &amp; ears tuning in to the Father &amp; with total faith You command the boy to rise from the dead! So natural. Superlative love, superlative oneness with Father, superlative faith. Lord, You live in a totally different dimension &amp; level of living &amp; being. I want that. Lord, transform me &amp; bring me to that dimension &amp; level of living &amp; walking in you &amp; with you!” I was feeding my spirit on Him &amp; that day I felt filled, satisfied &amp; full!</p>
            <p><strong>Peter</strong>  Another day the Lord led me to put myself in Peter’s shoes. I imagined him breaking bread once again after Jesus had risen &amp; remembering the Lord. What would he remember? I closed my eyes, imagined myself to be Peter &amp; followed his memories.</p>
            <p>“……I remember in the beginning when Jesus asked me to let down my nets into deep water (Luke 5). I saw His glory &amp; gave up everything to follow him. I remember the time when we trudged up the Mount of Transfiguration with Him &amp; saw His radiant glory &amp; heard, “ This is my beloved Son. Listen to Him.” I remember when He broke bread &amp; said, do this to remember Me. ( Tears come) I remember Jesus washing my feet &amp; feel His gentle touch once again. I remember Him on the cross, in total agony , yet crying out, “Father, forgive them , they do not know what they are doing.” (More tears come) I remember His words to me, “Do you love me? Feed my sheep.” (More tears) I remember You, Lord. I remember Your love, Your strength, Your purity, Your gentleness, Your holiness, Your majesty, Your humility, Your laughter, Your tears, Your suffering, Your words of truth, Your words of grace. I remember You - my Lord, my Friend, my waiting Bridegroom.”</p>
            <p>I was again feeding on Who Jesus is &amp; my heart was deeply drawn to Him with longing &amp; adoration.</p>
            <p>My communion experience: Ask “Lord, as I receive this bread &amp; cup from You, what do You want me to remember about You today?”</p>

            <p>He knelt to wash all his disciples’ feet, He was betrayed by a kiss, He was

            <h2>5. Body</h2>
            <p>Communion is about fully embracing the body &amp; family of Christ</p>
            <p>1 Cor 10:17 “For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.”</p>
            <p>Acts 2: 46 “So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart.”</p>
            <p>Acts 20:7 “Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread….”</p>
            <p>1 Cor 12: 27 “ Now you are the body of Christ, &amp; members individually.”</p>
            <p>The Bible records taking communion as a corporate act - the family of God coming together to share His life &amp; love. It can be a time of great rejoicing, empowerment &amp; healing. I remember a small Christian boarding school where I taught briefly. Every Sunday evening there was a special time of taking communion together. When the children received the bread, they would go up to different ones they had hurt during the week &amp; ask for forgiveness. Then they would break a piece of the bread &amp; give it to that person, signifying restored fellowship &amp; oneness. If there had been no offense, they would go to different ones as the Holy Spirit led to share a piece of the bread &amp; bless each other. Then joy &amp; worship would erupt in the room &amp; happy chatter followed. It was deeply moving to watch God’s children humble themselves &amp; be reconciled as they came to the table of His love.</p>

            <h3>Day 15 - Carrying The Body: In Love &amp; Reconciliation</h3>
            <p>Even when we take communion individually, we always remember the Body of Christ and carry the body with us in spirit.</p>
            <p>As I hear the words, “This is my body, given for you…this is my blood…shed for many for the forgiveness of sins,” I also hear, “Will you respond to my love with love? Will you also lay down your life for me? Will you love my body, my people &amp; lay down your life for them?” “As I forgave many, will you also forgive?” As I respond to Him, I leave with a fresh love &amp; devotion to the family.</p>
            <p>My communion experience: As you take communion, please respond to these questions. Who is He calling you to lay down your life for? Who is He asking you to forgive &amp; reconcile with?</p>

I declare oneness in the body of Christ, I declare oneness between Jew &amp; Arab, Jew &amp; gentile.</p>
            <p>Eph 2: 13-14,16 “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one…and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity.</p>

            <h3>Day 17 - Covenant Family</h3>
            <p>Eph 2: 13-15, 18-19 “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one …to create in Himself one new man from the two (Jew &amp; Gentile) ….For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.”</p>
            <p>We are a covenant family through His blood. When we receive communion, we are declaring once again that we belong to God’s one family &amp; we are never alone. In our church family, we often re-covenant with each other as family when we take communion together. We recommit ourselves to own the family &amp; to walk as a family of love. We declare nothing – no offense, no challenge, will separate us. We will always be one! For believers facing persecution today like they did in the early church, there is a price to pay even to break bread together. It would mean total trust &amp; a readiness to lay down their lives for each other.</p>
            <p>My communion experience: Take communion with God’s family, &amp; commit yourselves to be true covenant family, loving each other to the end.</p>

            <h3>Day 18 - Remembering Israel</h3>
            <p>Jesus established the communion on the Passover because He is the ultimate Passover Lamb who brings full deliverance to His people, Israel. “Lord, You once saved your people through the blood of the lamb at Passover, let the blood covenant of the Eternal Lamb be over your people to save them now!”</p>
            <p>One day as I took communion, I remembered Jesus was Jewish. He lived &amp; breathed Jewish culture. As a little boy growing up, the people, the sights, the sounds, &amp; the smell around Him were Jewish. He celebrated weekly Shabbat &amp; the feasts, He ate the local foods, He memorized Hebrew scripture. The first disciples were all Jewish. “the gospel… is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. (Rom 1:16) “Lord, as I take this bread &amp; cup, I pray for Your beloved Jewish kinsmen to know You as their Messiah and to come to cherish this bread &amp; cup. Lord, as I take this bread &amp; cup, I take it on behalf of the Jewish people who do not yet know to take it. Your body was broken for them, Your blood was shed for them. May you receive the full reward of Your suffering! ”</p>
            <p>Another day as I took the bread in communion, I remembered the bread of the Presence in the Holy Place (Ex 25:30). There were altogether 12 loaves placed in 2 piles &amp; they were replaced with fresh bread every Sabbath (Lev 24: 5-9). The 12 tribes of Israel needed to feed on His Presence to live but only the priests, the chosen representatives, could eat this bread. Only the priests could come &amp; minister in the Holy Place, the rest of the people could only worship in the outer court. But in the new covenant Jesus established, all of us who believe form the new priesthood that can come into His Presence &amp; feed on Him. The bread of the Presence actually points to Jesus, the true bread from heaven who can satisfy our hunger &amp; thirst forever. (John 6:35,51)</p>
            <p>“Lord, Your ancient people knew about feeding on You. They ate &amp; drank of Your goodness &amp; glory in Your Presence on the mountain (Ex 24:9-11). Your tangible manifest Presence was over the Tabernacle in the pillar of cloud by day &amp; the pillar of fire by night. The priests ate the sacred bread of the Presence that was in the Holy Place. O Lord, let them once again come to the table of Your Presence &amp; eat of You, the very Bread of Life &amp; be forever satisfied!”</p>
            <p>My communion experience: As you take communion, ask the Lord: what is Your heart for Your beloved Israel?</p>

            <h3>Day 19 - Corporate Carrier Of Spiritual Legacy</h3>
            <p>One day as I was taking communion, the Lord spoke to me about not just receiving His body, but also receiving &amp; embracing the body of Christ. He spoke about the Christian body collectively passing on the precious legacies of truth, faith &amp; life, just as families pass on their own legacies. But the global church family is a bigger family, passing on eternal values &amp; truths, &amp; precious traditions that hold those values &amp; truths. Above all, God’s family is called to pass on His living presence &amp; His heart to every generation, enlarging His kingdom till He comes. The corporate church family or Christian body is so important! That’s why we need to love it &amp; fully embrace it, and be part of the corporate carrier of His Presence &amp; Glory and of His purpose in history. Every individual &amp; every individual family from age to age are vital because together we make up the whole! Only together as we become one will we have the fullness! Even the spiritual giants &amp; saints of old have been waiting for us to be made complete! (see Heb 11:39-40)</p>
            <p>“O Abba, Eternal One of Israel, You are God from age to age. I submit &amp; commit myself to You &amp; to Your Body for Your eternal purposes, that I will find rest &amp; purpose as I walk with the Zion family You have so graciously brought me into. Destiny &amp; calling is about me but not all about me. I, Your little child, do my little part . I am part of the body &amp; I own the body fully. May Your will be done in Your people , in Zion, as we love You, seek after Your heart, &amp; choose to please You in all things. Abba Father, I am Yours, we are Yours. Father, enlarge my heart to own &amp; love my Zion family more, &amp; to relate to her &amp; your people in her in the way that pleases You. Yes, I want to love my family more! I also think of Your Jewish people who has been a corporate carrier of Your truth &amp; purpose from ancient times. O Lord, pour Your Spirit on them, make us one!”</p>
            <p>My communion experience: Ask the Lord for a revelation of the Body as you take communion. “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion (sharing,participation) of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.” (1Cor 10:16-17)</p>

            <h2>6. Blood</h2>
            <p>In the first Passover, the Passover Lamb was sacrificed &amp; its blood applied to the door posts &amp; lintels of Jewish homes. The mark of the blood distinguished those who were God’s people, saved them from death &amp; set them on the journey to the promised land, no longer slaves, but now sons &amp; daughters of the living God.</p>
            <p>Jesus is the true Passover Lamb who has been sacrificed to give us life! (1Cor 5:7) So in communion, we appropriate everything He paid for by His blood – forgiveness, freedom, new life in the Spirit, identity &amp; authority as sons &amp; daughters, protection, victory, healing &amp; more. When we take communion, we are declaring &amp; enforcing what was accomplished by His death on the cross.</p>
            <p>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes. (1Cor 11:26)</p>
            <p>(see Appendix 2 The Blood of Christ)</p>

            <h3>Day 20 - Protection &amp; Victory Over The Powers Of Darkness</h3>
            <p>There’s a blood covenant over us. Devil, hands off! God’s blood covenant is over us! He has bought us, His Bride, for Himself forever with the price of His blood. If He died for us, He will fight for us to the end! Who dares to meddle with God’s own?</p>
            <p>Rom 8:32-39 “He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-- how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died–more than that, who was raised to life–is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? …… No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</p>
            <p>1John 4:18 “There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment.”</p>
            <p>Rev 12: 11 “They overcame/defeated him (satan) by the blood of the Lamb.”</p>
            <p>The devil is afraid of the blood of Christ. When we take communion, we are applying the protective covering of His blood and demons keep their distance!</p>

            <p>Heb 12:24 “You have come…to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.” (NKJ) Heb 10:14 “because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.” (NIV)</p>
            <p>Jesus’ blood speaks not of condemnation, vengeance &amp; judgment but it speaks of forgiveness &amp; freedom! When we take the communion cup of His blood covenant, we are declaring that we are forgiven, worthy, accepted, made holy, set free! There is no more guilt, no more shame &amp; no more condemnation. We are set free to live out the glory of true sons &amp; daughters. We are set free to set others free, forgiven to forgive, given grace to extend grace. Yes, His blood speaks better things!</p>
            <p>As we slowly drink the communion cup, let every cell in our bodies rejoice in who we are in Christ. Let us confidently declare what His blood has enabled us to be!</p>
            <p>“Jesus, by Your blood, I am cleansed, forgiven, healed, restored &amp; set free from every curse, bondage &amp; fear! I am beloved, honored, esteemed, worthy, a child of Daddy God, the Bride of my bridegroom King! Christ in me makes me anointed, empowered, bold, wise, discerning, full of tender mercy, humble, pure &amp; filled with love, joy &amp; peace.

            <h3>Day 22 - Spiritual Restoration</h3>
            <p>One time as I took communion, the Lord spoke to my heart. “This is my blood shed for you, for the forgiveness of the sins of many. So receive the fullness of the power of the blood in the forgiveness of ALL the sins in your life – your sins &amp; the sins in your family line.” So I took time to repent &amp; receive, allowing the spirit to flow in me &amp; down my family line with His cleansing blood.</p>
            <p>Then I prayed to cut off all the sins &amp; consequences of sin from my family line in my life, including hereditary sicknesses.* “ I break off &amp; cut off the controlling spirit, fear of man, anxiety, eye disease, diabetes, dementia …… in Jesus’ mighty Name! I receive the full cleansing &amp; delivering power of the blood of Jesus! ”</p>
            <p>As the Holy Spirit leads, we may pray for the blood of Jesus to wash &amp; cleanse us to remove the negative influences from our family, our generational bloodline &amp; our culture as we take communion. **</p>
            <p>We repent &amp; ask for His blood to cleanse our natural bloodline . We acknowledge we are fully grafted into His divine bloodline through His blood &amp; we have the divine DNA of His nature – goodness, mercy, purity, courage, discernment…the full inheritance of all His divine attributes!</p>

            <h3>Day 23 - Physical Healing</h3>
            <p>Life is in the blood. As we take communion to “drink” His blood, we receive the very essence of His life. It is like receiving a transfusion of His divine life blood to replace our imperfect blood, bringing cleansing, restoration &amp; healing.</p>
            <p>“Lord, let Your life blood flow through my physical bloodstream to cleanse it &amp; restore it to optimum health! By your stripes I am healed.” (Is 53:5)</p>

            <h3>Day 24 - Healing The Heart</h3>
            <p>During one communion, He said to me: “This is my body given for you. Give me your heart, because from it flows the wellspring of life.” So I gave Him my heart, He put it in His treasure box, &amp; then He gave me His heart instead. “Treasure it, protect it. Make sure it’s my heart that’s in you all the time. If there’s some dust, brush it off because it’s a perfect heart. My heart is full of love for you, full of confidence &amp; faith in you, full of mercy, full of tender loving kindness, and out of this heart flows the wellspring of life, My heart in you. Treasure it. Look often inside it. When you live out of my heart, life becomes very different &amp; you become a very different person. This is the tree of life within you too. That’s another way of expressing it. ”</p>
            <p>So as we receive the bread representing His body, we give our broken and scarred hearts to Jesus and receive His heart of wholeness and Life instead.</p>
            <p>“Lord, I come for a heart transplant, that I may be radically transformed. I give you my heart . I receive Your heart instead. Embed it deep into my core being. Your heart in me, Your life in me, Your heartbeat in me! It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me!”</p>

            <h3>Day 25 - Resurrection Life &amp; Power</h3>
            <p>As I take bread &amp; cup, I pray, “Lord Jesus, You died to give me life, Your life. Let Your Resurrection Life flow through my body to give life to every cell, every joint &amp; ligament, and every organ. Restore, activate, resurrect.”</p>
            <p>One day as I took the bread &amp; remembered Him, Eph 1:18-23 came to mind. <br>“I pray… that you may know…His incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.”</p>
            <p>The power available for us is more than resurrection power. It is the power that seated Christ at God’s right hand far above all else &amp; put everything under His feet!</p>
            <p>“Lord, as I feed on You, I appropriate this power that brings EVERYTHING under Your feet. I declare my sickness is under Your feet. For ________ (person I was praying for) , Your incomparably great power is for _____ who believes You. So I declare all the depression, oppression &amp; bondages in his life broken &amp; put under the feet of Jesus. I call his spirit man to rise up to receive this incomparably great power in Christ!”</p>

            <p>As I take bread &amp; cup in communion, I picture Jesus on the cross with the curse of every sickness &amp; consequence of sin landing on Him &amp; ending there. “Lord, You have taken the curse of ______ from me onto yourself. It has no right to stay. It has to go! So in the Name of Jesus, I take authority to command _______ to leave me now! I receive Your blessing of ________.

            <p>Hearts soften &amp; bitterness melt away at the communion table when we look to Jesus on the cross.

            <p>Recently the Lord revealed the pride &amp; hardness of my heart towards a dear friend. I had often pondered why we were so different. But that day at the Global gathering in Jerusalem as I watched a Jewish woman representing Sarah kneel to wash the feet of an Egyptian woman representing Hagar, something powerful hit my spirit and I wept inside. It was her spirit of humility &amp; divine love. I realized I didn’t need to figure things out in the relationship with my friend. I just needed to humble myself &amp; wash her feet. The next day the Lord orchestrated a perfect time when we took communion together. I acknowledged my pride &amp; asked for forgiveness. I washed her feet &amp; she washed mine. Something beautiful happened, something was broken, &amp; there is a peace &amp; transparency in our relationship that was not there before.</p>
            <p>My communion experience: Ask the Lord: “Who do you want me to take communion with? How do I prepare my heart? What would you have me do or say?”</p>

He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us……He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups. Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death……<br>
                Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us……You are members of God’s family……We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord……this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit.”</p>

            <h3>Day 30 - Healing The Land</h3>
            <p>2 Sam 21 &amp; 24 both talk about healing the land.</p>
            <p>In the first story, there was famine for three successive years in Israel due to the sins of breaking covenant &amp; shedding innocent blood regarding the Gibeonites. Blood was needed to atone for bloodshed*, so seven male descendents of Saul, the culprit, were killed. “And after that, God heeded the prayer for the land.” (2 Sam 21: 14)</p>
            <p>In the second story, there was a three day plague brought on by David’s sin of taking the census. The plague ended when David built an altar to the Lord &amp; sacrificed burnt offerings &amp; peace offerings. “So the Lord heeded the prayers for the land &amp; the plague was withdrawn from Israel.” (2 Sam 24:25)</p>
            <p>In both instances, there was blood involved in healing the land. Today we can apply the blood of Jesus instead of animal sacrifice or taking human lives, and what better way to apply the blood of Jesus than taking the communion. Where we know there has been defilement of the land, especially by the sins of idolatry, shedding innocent blood, breaking covenants, removing ancient boundary stones and sexual immorality, we may, as the Spirit leads, build an altar of worship there, offering the blood of Jesus through corporate communion to bring healing to the land.** In communion, there would also be repentance, reconciliation &amp; re-consecration of the land &amp; people back to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Remember the night of the Passover? The blood of a lamb was put on the sides &amp; tops of the door frames of the houses of the Israelites. The blood was the sign that separated these houses from the rest &amp; protected them from the deathly plague when the Lord judged the gods of Egypt. (Exodus 12:7,12-13). Do we have the blood of the Lamb over our household &amp; property? What better way to apply the blood of the Lamb &amp; place our household under His blood than taking communion together there! Yes!</p>
            <p>Thank you, Lord, for Your precious blood that saves, purifies, protects, heals &amp; gives life! Thank you for Your blood, thank You for Your amazing grace!</p>
            <p>My communion experience: Just like the story in the beginning, as you take communion, re-establish your covenant with the Lord, dedicate your home &amp; everything in it to Him, repent as He leads &amp; remove any idols. Let Him cleanse &amp; fill your heart &amp; home anew!</p>

            <p>**Lev 18:25 “Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, (sexual sins listed in Lev18) and the land vomited out its inhabitants.”</p>
            <p>Is 24: 5-6 “The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes &amp; broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt.”</p>
            <p>Heb 9:22 “In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”</p>

            <h3>8. Some Suggestions For Taking Communion</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It’s a good idea to have a special set place &amp; also set times where you take communion, let’s say, first thing in the morning in a special corner of your room. You can even have daily or regular corporate communion with others through the phone. You can decorate the corner where you take communion with things that draw you to Jesus, like a cross or a painting.</li>
                <li>Start with singing a worship song that will help your heart &amp; spirit focus on the Lord</li>
                <li>You can pray: “Lord, lead this time of communion with You. Let me encounter You &amp; hear You.”</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Picture Jesus personally giving you the bread &amp; the cup. Receive them from His hands.</p>
            <p>Fix your eyes on Him &amp; hear Him say, “This is my body, broken for you, do this in remembrance of Me. This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.” Let Him continue to speak and guide your thoughts.</p>

            <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Communion is a gift &amp; joy. Taking communion daily is a gift &amp; joy. It helps us to continually focus on Jesus &amp; His cross. We receive the blessing of daily alignment to the heart &amp; will of God, intimacy, empowerment, spiritual protection &amp; more. It is not a law but an amazing privilege. The Lord had a heart to bless when He commanded the children of Israel to bring daily offerings, morning &amp; evening , then on top of that, weekly Sabbath offerings, and then on top of that, monthly offerings, then on top of that, annual offerings at Passover, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement &amp; Feast of Tabernacles (Nu 28). He wanted to set a holy rhythm &amp; cycle of worship into the lives of His people so they will never stray far from their Beloved &amp; become lost in the complexities of life. Set times of drawing near to God create a spiritual pattern over God’s people &amp; change the spiritual atmosphere around them. These times bring continual alignment to the heart &amp; will of the Father who loves us. Communion is a New Testament gift &amp; commandment for this purpose. The tangible bread &amp; cup help us refocus on Jesus &amp; His cross. It is a declaration of His Kingship over us. It is also a proclamation of the death, resurrection &amp; second coming of Jesus into the atmosphere! (1Cor 11:26) So seek the Lord how often you should take communion individually &amp; corporately. If the Lord puts on your heart to set time apart for daily communion, don’t take it lightly, you’ll be blessed! Be flexible as to the length of time the communion should take. It could be short or long depending on the time available &amp; how the Holy Spirit moves!</p>
            <p>The Lord laid it on my heart to write this simple booklet because I felt God’s people need to take communion often in order to face the challenges of the end times before His return. We need the daily alignment, renewal, intimacy, empowerment &amp; protection that come from communion to stand. I also feel a time is coming when it will be the norm for believers to gather together daily to worship &amp; break bread as they did in Acts.</p>
            <p>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved. (Act 2:46-47 NKJ)</p>
            <p>Yes, He will also add daily those being saved &amp; make us ready for His coming! Yes, come, Lord Jesus!</p>

            <h3>Appendix 1 Biblical references to Communion</h3>
            <p>Matt. 26:17, 26-29<br>
                17 Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?” ….<br>
                26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed1 and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, &quot;Take, eat; this is My body.&quot;<br>
                27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, &quot;Drink from it, all of you.<br>
                28 &quot;For this is My blood of the new1 covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br>
                29 “But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kin gdom.” (New King James Version)</p>
            <p>Mark 14:22-25<br>
                22 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, &quot;Take, eat1; this is My body.&quot;<br>
                23 Then He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.<br>
                24 And He said to them, &quot;This is My blood of the new1 covenant, which is shed for many.<br>
                25 “Assuredly, I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</p>
            <p>Luke 22:7-20<br>
                7 Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed.<br>
                8 And He sent Peter and John, saying, &quot;Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.&quot;<br>
                9 So they said to Him, &quot;Where do You want us to prepare?&quot;<br>
                10 And He said to them, &quot;Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters.<br>
                11 &quot;Then you shall say to the master of the house,`The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”'<br>
                12 &quot;Then he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.&quot;<br>
                13 So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.<br>
                14 When the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve1 apostles with Him.<br>
                15 Then He said to them, &quot;With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;<br>
                16 &quot;for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&quot;<br>
                17 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, &quot;Take this and divide it among yourselves;<br>
                18 &quot;for I say to you1, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&quot;<br>
                19 And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &quot;This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot;<br>
                20 Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.</p>
            <p>Act 2:41-42 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</p>
            <p>Acts 2:46 So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart.</p>
            <p>Acts 20:7 Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread….</p>
            <p>1 Cor 11:20, 23-32<br>
                20 …the Lord’s Supper…<br>
                23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;<br>
                24 and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &quot;Take, eat1; this is My body which is broken2 for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot;<br>
                25 In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&quot;<br>
                26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.<br>
                27 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood1 of the Lord.<br>
                28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.<br>
                29 For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner1 eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s2 body.<br>
                30 For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.<br>
                31 For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.<br>
                32 But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</p>
            <p>1 Cor 10:16-17 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion(sharing, participation)* of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion* of the body of Christ? For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.</p>
            <p>*Greek: κοινωνία koinonia: fellowship, association, community, communion, joint participation, intimacy</p>
            <p>1 Cor 5:7 For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.</p>

            <h3>Appendix 2 Biblical references to the Blood of Christ</h3>
            <p>Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? <br>(1Co 10:16 NIV)</p>
            <p>Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. (Eph 2:12-13 NIV)</p>
            <p>He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. <br>(Heb 9:12 NIV)</p>
            <p>How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! (Heb 9:14 NIV)</p>
            <p>We have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <br>(Heb 10:10 NIV)</p>
            <p>It was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. (1Pe 1:18-19 NIV)</p>
            <p>To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father (Rev 1:5-6 NIV)</p>
            <p>We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, (Heb 10:19-20 NIV)</p>
            <p>You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. (Heb 12:23-24 NIV)</p>
            <p>The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. (Heb 13:11-12 NIV)</p>
            <p>May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep. (Heb 13:20 NIV)</p>
            <p>Who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. (1Pe 1:2 NIV)</p>
            <p>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. (1Jo 1:7 NIV)</p>
            <p>Jesus said to them, &quot;I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. (John 6:53 NIV)</p>
            <p>Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood. <br>(Act 20:28 NIV)</p>
            <p>God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. <br>(Rom 3:25 NIV)</p>
            <p>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him! (Rom 5:9 NIV)</p>
            <p>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins <br>(Eph 1:7 NIV)</p>
            <p>For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation. (Col 1:19-22 NIV)</p>
            <p>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death–that is, the devil–and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death <br>(Heb 2:14-15 NIV)</p>
            <p>And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll, And to open its seals; For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, And have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth.” (Rev 5:9-10 NKJ)</p>
            <p>They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. <br>(Rev 7:14 NIV)</p>
            <p>Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.(Rev 12:10-11 NIV)</p>
